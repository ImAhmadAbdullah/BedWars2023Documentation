Spectate a suspicious player.

#### How does it work?
When a player gets reported for cheating your staff can use this command to join
the right arena and automatically spectate that player.
BedWarsProxy will search in every connected arena for the player and then will give a result.

#### Usage

| Command           | Description                            | Permission      |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------|
| `/bw tp <player>` | Teleport and spectate a suspect player | `bw.tp`         |
