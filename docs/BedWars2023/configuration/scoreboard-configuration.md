Since we decided to use [TAB](https://github.com/NEZNAMY/TAB) plugin by Neznamy, we support almost all features they have to offer. Below you can find some commonly used features.

Make sure to also understand the limitations of the scoreboard [Limitations](https://github.com/NEZNAMY/TAB/wiki/Feature-guide:-Scoreboard#limitations)

### Longer Scoreboard Lines 
Lines with not frequently changing placeholders can have a character limit up towards 64 characters (including color codes)
To achieve this make sure to add `Long|` in front of the longer lines you want to display. Change this in the language files under the scoreboard section.
