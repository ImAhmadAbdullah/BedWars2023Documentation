### Creating custom scoreboards
You can create custom scoreboards per [Arena Groups](https://wiki.andrei1058.dev/docs/BedWars1058/setup/arena-groups/). So, let's suppose you have an arena group called `4v4v4v4`, then you can create a custom scoreboard for the arenas using this arena group. You can edit the scoreboard for each arena state (waiting, starting, playing). So let's suppose you want to have a custom playing scoreboard. Just go in the language file, under the `scoreboard` section and add yur arena group name and under it, the arena status name:
```yaml
scoreboard:
  4v4v4v4:
    playing:
    - "&f&lBED WARS"
    - "&7{date}"
    - ""
    - "{TeamRedColor}&lB&f {TeamRedName}&f: {TeamRedStatus}"
    - "{TeamBlueColor}&lB&f {TeamBlueName}&f: {TeamBlueStatus}"
    - "{TeamGreenColor}&lG&f {TeamGreenName}&f: {TeamGreenStatus}"
    - "{TeamYellowColor}&lY &f{TeamYellowName}&f: {TeamYellowStatus}"
    - ""
    - "&6{server_ip}"
```

### Player list configuration
It is possible to add multiple lines to the header and footer of the player list by adding more lines as shown below.
Make sure to add `|-` on the first row.
```yaml
format-sb-tab-header:
  lobby: |-
    just put anything.
    &bplaying on: &a{serverIp}
    it
    can
    go
    quite
    far 
    down
    And you dont need to use quotes like this: ""
```

All placeholders that are listed under [Global Placeholders](language-configuration#global-placeholders) are supported.

### Scoreboard placeholders

#### Team placeholers:
Using team placeholders is easy. Let's suppose that you have a team called `Bread`, then your team's placeholders are:
- `{TeamBreadColor}` - shows the team color.
- `{TeamBreadName}` - shows the team name.
- `{TeamBreadStatus}` - shows the team status. (alive, dead etc.)

An easier alternative is using `{team}` placeholder which will take the team format from the message at path: `format-sb-team-generic` (by default {TeamColor}{TeamLetter}&f {TeamName}: {TeamStatus}). This placeholder can be used in multiple lines and it will iterate the team list of the arena and will asign it a team. When the placeholder is used more than team list size the scoreboard line with {team} in it will be skipped.

##### Upgrade placeholders:
Upgrades are divided in tiers each upgrade will have a corresponding line containing the cost and currency and the tier color, this makes the tier show up as purchased or not. 
All variables mentioned below are gathered from `upgrades2.yml`.
- `{tier_x_color}` - changes the color based on purchased or not.
- `{tier_x_cost}` - shows the cost of the upgrade.
- `{tier_x_currency}` - shows the currency used to buy the upgrade.

When adding a tier to `upgrades2.yml` you should add another line in each of the language files used. and replace the `x` with the corresponding tier number.

Custom title/ sub-title for arena countdown
---------
You can add a custom title for certain second by adding this to the language file `arena-start-countdown-title-[second]` where `[second]` can be 4 etc. For adding a custom subTitle use this path: `arena-start-countdown-subtitle-[second]`. Available placeholder: `{second}`.

Countdown titles and subtitles are shown when the current second is `currentSecond % 10 == 0 || currentSecond <= 5`.
